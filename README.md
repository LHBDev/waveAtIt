WaveAtIt is an ongoing computer vision project application allowing for the control of your computer through your webcam with no additional hardware required. Development began during participation at HackTXAllows movement of mouse cursor, scroll, left/right click, using one's hands. Plans include to introduce gesture control as well as augmented reality HUD and full emulation of keyboard and numpad plus custom AR applications. If all goes well final product will also include voice command recognition.
